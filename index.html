<h3>Recommender system causal bias elimination</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Independently completed a full-stack industrial recommendation project, including pair requirements, data washing, feature engineering, multi-task model design, causal bias elimination algorithm design, deployment flow cutting, and metrics optimization
</p>
</li>
<li><p>ESMM is a classic multi-task recommendation model in the industry. We demonstrate that the CVR estimation of ESMM suffers from an eigenbias problem, and CTCVR estimation also introduces an incorrect conditional independent prior.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>To address this problem, ESCM is proposed with the intention of using causal debiasing techniques to regularize the ESMM model and demonstrate that it can significantly mitigate the bias and conditional independence problems.
