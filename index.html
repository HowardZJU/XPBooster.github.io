<ol>
<li><p>I was selected for the cross-innovation class (25 students) in the Dual Brain Center of Zhejiang University.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>I served as a minister of the Faculty Student Union, and minister of the competition department, Artificial Intelligence Association.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>I joined the &ldquo;Smart Rice-Fishery for Rural Revitalization&rdquo; project (Internet+ Gold Award, Challenge Cup Gold Award) and directed machine learning demonstration.

<h2>Ant Group - Intelligent Engine Division</h2>
<h3>Recommender system causal bias elimination</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>I completed a full-stack industrial recommender for Ant Insurance business: requirements communication, data preparation, feature engineering, algorithm coding, online deployment and performance tuning.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>I demonstrated that ESMM, a classic multi-task recommendation model, suffered from inherent bias for CVR estimation. ESCM was further proposed, which regularizes ESMM with counterfactual risks.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Results: The effectiveness of ESCM was demonstrated theoretically. ESCM was deployed on 1) <a href="https://www.mayibao.cn/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Alipay insurance</a> product page, 2) insurance shelf page, 3) Wufu promotion page, serving 6 million UVs in 10 days, increasing 4 percent business billing and 8 percent actual premiums. We released a patent, a research paper and an article on the Alibaba Technology Association.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Huawei - Noah's Ark Lab</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>I am exploring the intersection of causal inference and domain adaptation. Specifically, I am interested in theoretical and experimental exploration of causal inference based on optimal transport.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>I am also interested in the multi-task multi-objective recommenders. Specifically, I am interested in automatically fine-tuning target weights during training via a PID controller.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Atmospheric radiation monitoring and nuclear accident early warning</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Background: We explored on the process monitoring and predictive maintenance of nuclear accidents using massive data from 38 measurement stations.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dose-rate forecasting: We implemented forecasting methods of multi-head attention, spatio-temporal attention, hidden cycle modeling, and spatio-temporal graph networks, acquiring 0.95+ r2.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Auto-encoder for Residual Information Mining: We derived a residual architecture through a variational approach, which maximized the joint-likelihood of features and labels directly.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Results: We released 1 journal paper (under review), 3 conference papers, 1 oral presentation at China Process Control Conference.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>XPBoost</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Background: VC-dimension limits the upper bound of generalization for deep learning; SGD suffers from complex covariance.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contribution: We proposed a new problem of neural network post-optimization. We devised XPBoost, which solved this problem through intelligent optimization and cross-dimensional reduction technology.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Results: We improved the baselines by 0.5-3 percent, released 1 paper (under review).
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Decoupling and Recognition of micro-Doppler signals for complex dynamic multi-targets</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Target dynamic model: We established the target microdynamic model supporting 3 motion characteristics, 8 electromagnetic parameters and 3 radar modes.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Decoupling algorithm: We devised algorithms based on variational modal decomposition to decouple the echo signals from different targets.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Recognition algorithm: We devised inter-channel attention modules to adapt model to images with low SNR, and beat the best model in micro-motion mode recognition.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Results: We released 2 patent, 1 thesis, and got the excellent thesis award of Central South University.
